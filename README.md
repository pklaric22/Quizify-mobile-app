## Domain Description
Quizify is an application for quiz enthusiasts, designed to provide users with a fun and challenging experience through diverse trivia and knowledge tests. The platform covers a wide range of topics, including geography, literature, history, music, culture, languages, science, and many more. It enables users to test their knowledge, compete with friends or the global community, and discover new facts. Quizify stands out by allowing players to choose the categories they wish to answer (unless they opt for "mixed" questions) and adjust the difficulty of the questions. Additionally, users can add their acquaintances and friends, as well as make new friendships through knowledge competitions. Quizify tracks each player's progress by awarding points for correct answers, which are recorded in their personal player profile. Besides entertainment, Quizify provides an opportunity to gain new knowledge and quiz experiences, serving as a form of preparation for more serious quizzes conducted in real-life quiz leagues and tournaments. The application also offers various game modes: players can compete in speed-based modes where they must answer questions within a set timer or opt for the classic mode where they answer a predefined number of questions without time restrictions, with success depending on the number of correct answers.

## Project Specification

ID | Name | Brief Description 
---|------|-----------------
F01 | Registration and Login | Quizify will enable users to register with their credentials if they are using the app for the first time or log in if they have already used the app.
F02 | Manual Question Entry | Users will have the ability to add questions of their choice for a desired category.
F03 | Quiz Creation | Quizify will allow quizzes to be created based on question categories, game modes, and difficulty levels. Quizzes can be created with randomly selected categories or user-preferred ones, as well as by difficulty level (easy, medium, hard).
F04 | Player Performance Tracking | The application will include an experience point system. This feature will allow users to view: Overall rankings compared to other players, Total experience points earned, History of played quizzes with correct and incorrect answers, and Score growth charts over time.
F05 | Leaderboard Display | The application will feature a leaderboard displaying players ranked by their achievements. Two leaderboards will be available: one comparing the user to their friends and another showing the top 10 players with the highest points.
F06 | Performance by Category | Users will be able to view their performance by category within the app. Additional information, such as the most frequently answered question and the percentage of players who answered it correctly, will be displayed in graphical form.
F07 | Game History Review | Users can review their game history, including dates, results, and selected categories. This functionality helps players track their progress over time and analyze their successes and failures.
F08 | Achievement Rewards | The application will include an achievement reward system through experience points. Players will earn points for achievements, such as correct answers to questions, with emphasis on harder questions that yield more points. Rules for point allocation also include point deductions for incorrect answers, allowing players to track their overall progress through point gains or losses.
F09 | Question Database Creation | Quizify will fetch its question database from the API at https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10 and use it for quiz creation and quiz questions.

## Technologies and Equipment
For the implementation of the solution, I will use the Kotlin programming language and the Android Studio development environment. For the user interface, I have chosen to use the XML framework. Additionally, we will use Git for version control and host the repository on the GitHub platform. Documentation will be maintained via GitHub Wiki as per the mentor's instructions, and project tasks will be planned and tracked within GitHub Projects. All utilized technologies are publicly available and free to use, ensuring transparency and accessibility of our software product.
